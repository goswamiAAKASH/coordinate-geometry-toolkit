# Geometry Toolkit - Software Engineering Documentation
## Applying Agile Methodology as a Solo Developer

---

## Project Overview

### What We Built in this Project
A **Coordinate Geometry Toolkit** - an interactive web application for visualizing geometric shapes like points, lines, circles, triangles, and conic sections. Built using Python, Streamlit, and mathematical libraries.

### Why Agile for Solo Development?
- **Flexibility**: Adapt to changing requirements as I learned more
- **Iterative Development**: Build and test small pieces at a time
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular self-reflection and adaptation
- **Risk Management**: Identify and fix problems early

## Agile Methodology Implementation

### Core Agile Principles Applied

#### 1. **Working Software Over Documentation**
- Built functional features first, documented later
- Users could see and use the application quickly
- Created basic shape classes first, then added comprehensive documentation

#### 2. **Responding to Change Over Following a Plan**
- Adapted when discovering better solutions
- Added error handling when users entered invalid values
- Better product than originally planned

#### 3. **Individuals and Interactions**
- Clear communication with potential users
- Simplified interface based on user feedback
- Better understanding of requirements

## Solo Scrum Framework

### My Role as Solo Developer
- **Product Owner**: Decided feature priorities and requirements
- **Developer**: Implemented all features and functionality
- **Tester**: Created and ran all tests
- **Scrum Master**: Self-managed the development process

### Solo Scrum Events

#### **Sprint Planning** (Weekly)
- Review backlog, select features for the week
- 30 minutes every Monday
- Focus: What can I realistically complete this week?

#### **Daily Standups** (Self-Reflection)
- 5-minute self-check every morning
- Questions: What did I complete yesterday? What will I work on today? What obstacles am I facing?

#### **Sprint Review** (Weekly)
- Demo completed features to myself
- Focus: Does this meet the requirements?
- Update backlog based on learnings

#### **Sprint Retrospective** (Weekly)
- 15-minute self-reflection
- Questions: What went well this week? What could I improve? How can I work more efficiently?

## Error Resolution & Feedback Loop

### Frontend to Backend Problem Solving
One of the key software engineering practices applied was the **feedback loop** - identifying issues in the frontend and systematically resolving them in the backend.

#### **Issue Discovery Process**
1. **Frontend Testing**: Users interact with the web interface
2. **Error Identification**: Problems surface through user input or system errors
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Trace issues back to their source in backend classes
4. **Backend Fixes**: Implement proper solutions in the core classes
5. **Frontend Updates**: Adjust user interface to prevent future issues

#### **Real Examples from This Project**

**Example 1: ValueError in Shape Creation**
- **Frontend Issue**: Users could enter zero values for ellipse semi-axes
- **Error**: `ValueError("Semi-axis lengths must be positive.")`
- **Backend Solution**: Modified `Ellipse` class constructor to handle zero values gracefully
- **Frontend Update**: Added input validation with minimum values
- **Result**: Smooth user experience with proper error handling

**Example 2: Abstract Method Implementation**
- **Frontend Issue**: `Hyperbola` and `Parabola` classes couldn't be instantiated
- **Error**: `TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class`
- **Backend Solution**: Implemented missing `area()` and `perimeter()` methods
- **Result**: All shape classes now work seamlessly

**Example 3: Plotting Failures**
- **Frontend Issue**: Some shapes didn't display properly in the visualization
- **Error**: `None` values in plotting data
- **Backend Solution**: Added robust point generation and error handling
- **Frontend Update**: Enhanced plotting logic with fallback mechanisms
- **Result**: Reliable visualization for all shape types
